# precious-metal-tracker
It shows a dynamic chart and performance table for several precious metals (Gold, Silver, Platinum, Palladium, Copper, Zinc). The chart illustrates the last 30 days of pricing, and the table highlights changes over different time frames (Today, 30 Days, 6 Months, 1 Year, 5 Years, 20 Years). A dropdown lets you switch between metals.
